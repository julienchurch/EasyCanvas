# LightFX 

LightFX is a small library for adding canvas-based UI effects. It is not a canvas manipulation library like FabricJS; instead it offers a handful of things I've always been unsatisfied with in native CSS.

This README is pending an overhaul with examples and more documentation. In the meantime, feel free to investigate the API.
